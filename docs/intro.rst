Sidekick is primarly a wrapper around VMWare and VirtualBox to provide a workflow and a development environment for Yaybu users running on Linux and OSX, however it can potentially work with other configuration management tools too.

Our goal is:

 * To make reproducable development environments
 * To make it quick and easy to go from a cold start and clean slate to having a fully working environment
 * 'Develop as you mean to deploy' - think about deployment of your code from the beginning and ensure ops have time to input into development requirements

A nice side effect is that in supporting VMWare and VirtualBox we can also support libcloud and deploy the same environments to our favourite cloud provider. Great to demonstrate a new feature to a customer before an actual rollout.
