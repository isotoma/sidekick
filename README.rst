What is Yaybu Sidekick?
-----------------------

Any good hero needs a sidekick, and Yaybu Sidekick is yours. Think of it as a
Software Development Kit.. Kit. You can define a dev environment for your team
and be sure everyone has that environment with one checkout and one Sidekick
command. Better: when it changes they can run that command again and bring it
up to date.

For teams using Yaybu to power their deployment, Yaybu Sidekick encourages
your developers to think about their deployment up front instead of turning
up on release day with a model plane kit with half the parts missing.


Installing
----------

Installation is currently from git using the normal python setuptools
incantations. I'll write better docs when this code is more useful.


Current Status
--------------

Yaybu Sidekick is an experiment in using the VMWare VIX API and in using
Yaybu as an API rather than as a tool. It's still too early to know if
it will be useful.

It currently targets:

  * VMWare
  * Yaybu

It may gain support for:

  * libcloud
  * VirtualBox
  * KVM (via libvirt)


Credits
-------

Yaybu Sidekick is inspired by the excellent Vagrant project.

The low level ctypes bindings for VMWare were originally generated by Paul McGuire
of pyparsing and are used and extended here with his blessing. Thanks Paul!
